[What is EJSCREEN](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/what-ejscreen)

### What is EJSCREEN? 
* Environmental justice mapping and screening tool 
* Provides EP nationally consistent dataset 
* Combines environmental and demographics 
* EJSCREEN developed by EP 
    * Purpose: 
        * highlight places that has potential for "further review, analysis or outreach to support environmental justice work" 

**Includes:**  

* |11 environmental indicators|
    * https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/overview-environmental-indicators-ejscreen
    * potential interests to project: (I believe this is the one that I selected)
        1. National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) air toxics cancer risk
            * Lifetime cancer risk from inhalation of air toxics 
            * Data is from 2014 
            * Source: [EPA NATA](https://www.epa.gov/national-air-toxics-assessment/2014-nata-assessment-results) 
            
        2. NATA respiratory hazard index  
            * source: Air toxics respiratory hazard index (ratio of exposure concentration to health-based reference concentration)
            * Year: 2014 
        3. Traffic proximity and volume
            * Count of vehicles (AADT, avg. annual daily traffic) at major roads within 500 meters, divided by distance in meters (not km)
            * Calculated from 2017 U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) traffic data,
            * retrieved 2019	2017
         4. * NATA diesel PM
             * Air
             * Diesel particulate matter level in air, Âµg/m3
             * EPA NATA
             * Data year 2014
* [6 demographic indicators](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/overview-demographic-indicators-ejscreen)
    * six demographic indicators:
    1. Percent Low-Income:
        * The percent of a block group's population in households where the household income is less than or equal to twice the federal "poverty level."
    2. Percent People of Color:
        * The percent of individuals in a block group who list their racial status as a race other than white alone and/or list their ethnicity as Hispanic or Latino. That is, all people other than non-Hispanic white-alone individuals. The word "alone" in this case indicates that the person is of a single race, not multiracial.
3. Less than high school education:
    * Percent of people age 25 or older in a block group whose education is short of a high school diploma.
4. Linguistic isolation:
    * Percent of people in a block group living in linguistically isolated households. A household in which all members age 14 years and over speak a non-English language and also speak English less than "very well" (have difficulty with English) is linguistically isolated.
5. Individuals under age 5:
    * Percent of people in a block group under the age of 5.
6. Individuals over age 64:
    * Percent of people in a block group over the age of 64.

* EJSCREEN includes an index that is based on the above demographic indicators:
    * A Demographic Index is based on the average of two demographic indicators; **Percent Low-Income and Percent Minority.**
* [11 EJ indexes](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/environmental-justice-indexes-ejscreen)
    * EJ index = combination of environmental and demographic info.
    * Eleven EJ Indexes in EJSCREEN reflecting the 11 environmental indicators.
        1. National Scale Air Toxics Assessment Air Toxics Cancer Risk
        2. National Scale Air Toxics Assessment Respiratory Hazard Index
        3. National Scale Air Toxics Assessment Diesel PM (DPM)
        4. Particulate Matter (PM2.5)
        5. Ozone
        6. Lead Paint Indicator
        7. Traffic Proximity and Volume
        8. Proximity to Risk Management Plan Sites
        9. Proximity to Treatment Storage and Disposal Facilities
        10. Proximity to National Priorities List Sites
        11. Wastewater Discharge Indicator


## [Limitations for EJSCREEN](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/limitations-and-caveats-using-ejscreen) 
### * **Disclosure:** 
* EJSCREEN not to be used for "detailed risk analysis" 
    * 1. Data in Demographic and environmental has "substantial uncertainty"  
        * specifically in **small areas**
        * SIngle block group mostly small and has "uncertain estimates" 
            * Recommend to, "Summarize EJSCREEN data within a larger area that may cover several block groups, in what is called a "buffer" report". 
    * 2. Does not provide data on **on every environmental impact and demographic indicator**
        * One reason is because: 
            * There are many environmental concerns not yet included in comprehensive, nationwide databases. 
            * For example: Data on Environmental factors like drinking water quality and indoor qir quality 
* Estimates on Demographics: 
    * (ex: percent low-income, come from surveys, not a full census of all households). 
    * This means the Census Bureau may estimate that a block group is 30% low-income, for example, but it might actually be 20% or 40% in some cases.
    * All indicators calculated for **each block group**.
        *  "Only exception = certain environmental indicators for air quality (PM, ozone, and NATA indicators). Those air data were obtained for each Census tract, so each block group in a tract was assigned the same environmental indicator value, as described in the Technical Documentation."
* Environmental indicators, there's uncertainty screening-level proxies for actual health impacts. 
    * Also applicable to indecaotrs with direct estimate risk or hazards 
        Ex: Air toxics cancer risk indicator 
            * uncertain indicators: 
                * Emissions
                * Exposure 
                * Toxicity

* "The National Priorities List (NPL) is the list of sites of national priority among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throughout the United States and its territories". 
* "The NPL is intended primarily to guide the EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation."
