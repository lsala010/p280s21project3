# A Comparative Analysis of Exposure to Respiratory Hazards and School Performance in Southern California.

## Abstract
This section shall be completed after the other sections of the manuscript have been completed

## Background
This section shall contain the literature review elements in addition to reasoning behind the research topic selection

Air toxins from industrial pollution have significantly adverse effects on human health outcomes. *insert more information about air toxins + citations)* Riverside County, the largest county in California's Inland Empire, is known for its high levels of air pollution and air toxics exposure. The effects of such exposure to human health such as respiratory function have been thoroughly examined, with the region notably containing rates of pediatric asthma that exceed California health and safety standards. (*insert citations here*) There is existing literature linking air toxics exposure to decreased academic performance. In a study of school children in China, researchers found a significant association between air pollution, particularly levels of NO2, and poorer results on neurobehavioral tests designed to measure the childrenâ€™s sensory, motor, and psychomotor functions (Wang et al., 2009). It is important to note, however, that exposure to pollutants and decreased academic performance are not necessarily the result of SES variables. A recent study assessing the association between environmental toxicants and _____

## Data and Methods

## Results
This section shall contain the results as well as data visualizations, tables and analysis

## Discussion and conclusions
This section shall discuss whether the results were in line with existing research and anticipated results, how the study may be improved, policy recommendations (with research backing them) and highlighting the need of further research regarding environmental exposure and academic performance
