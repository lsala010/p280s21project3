## Notes on Policy Recommendation 

1. California’s Cap-and-Trade Program Has Proven Effective – Now Let’s Make it Equitable  
* **Summary:** 
    * The Cap-and-Trade Program/regulation permits the state to put a cap on facilities that emit carbon dioxide (or air pollutants), in an attempt to decrease the level of pollution in the air. 
    * The author references [a study] that reveals how the Cap and Trade has increased the level of pollution in disadvatanged communities (mainly low-income and minority neighborhoods) as they bear the heavy weight of being exposed to harmful air pollutants. 
    * Since 2017, the Cap-and-Trade was modified to disallow the state and local government agencies to regulate "facility emissions at their source."
    * Therefore, preventing agencies such as the California Air Resources Board and "local air districts" from targeting specific pollutors. .  
    * The author argues that the California State Legislature should remove the ban in order to allow state and local agencies to regulate air pollution within their local vicinity. 
    * State and local governments can specifically target facilities to reduce their carbon emissions in ares where vulnerable communities are most impacted; by reducing carbon emissions in those areas. 

## 2. Cap-and-Trade Regulation Instructional Guidance- CHAPTER 1: HOW DOES THE CAP-AND-TRADE PROGRAM WORK
`Sept 2012`
* Summary: 

* Notes: 
will be compacted into summary section - notes will be removed for organization purposes  
* Chapter 1: How Does the Cap-and-Trade Program Work? 
    * **Cap-and-Trade Program**  
        * Reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by setting caps on major green house gas emissions producers.
            * goal is to reduce GHG 
        * GHG emissions are measures in "metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e)
        * The requirements for "covered entity" include "to surrender one permit to emit", "for each ton of GHG emssions they emit"
            * Some GHG producers would be able to use and buy"some allowances" either in auction, or be it "purchased from others", "or even purchase offset credits". 
        * Potential critic: Program is intended "to decline over time" even though it started in 2013 
    * Mandatory Reporting of GHG Regulation or MRR 
        * Cap-and-Trade Program uses the data collected from the MRR or Madatiry reporting Regulation. 
            * identifing "major sources of GHG" in CA 
            * Entities that are required report GHG: 
                1. "Facilities, feul, and carbon dioxide (CO2) suppliers"
                2. Electric power entities 
    * Basics if Cap Program: 
        * **Allowance:** tradeable permit to emit one metric ton of CO2 equvalent greenhouse gas emission 
        * **Offset Credit:** equivalent to a GHG reduction or GHG removal enhancement of one metric ton of CO2e. 
        * **Compliance Instruments**: used by entities to comply, they include ARB offset credits and allowances.  
            * "The GHG reduction or GHG removal enhancement must be real, additional, quantifiable, permanent, verifiable, and enforceable and may only be issues to offset projects using approved Compliance Offset Protocols.
            * GHG producers are only allowed to use 8% of its ARB offset credits to comply with compliance obligations. 
    * **Compliance Period:** Time frame of complicance obligation calculated 
        * End of each compliance time period, facilities are required to turn in allowances and a "limited number of ARB offset credits". 
            * Limited ARB offset credits are based on the equivalent to their total GHG emissions through the compliance period
            
            * First: 2013-2014  
            * Second: 2015-2017 
            * Third: 2018-2020
    * Who Complies: 
        * 2012 big GHG-emitting sources 
            * Electricity generatio (includes imports)
            * large stationary siurces (refineries, cement production faciliti8es, oill gas prduction facilities glass manufacturing faciliti8es, food processing plants )
            * Where they emit more than 25,000 MTCO2e per year ha to comply with CAP
        * 2015 expanded to include fuel distributors   
        * Some facilities required to report annual emissions but not be required to "surrender compliance instruements". 
            * it depends: 
                * Companies that emit 10,000 or more metric tons of co2e 
                    * required: submit report on their GHGs 
                * "Subset of industgrial facilities with annual emissions equivalent to or greater than 25,000 metric tons of co2e = required to comply with CAP program  
            * Major GHG emission sources   
   * Cap-and-Trade Regulation: 
       * major GHG producers before deadlines must: 
           * register with ARB
           * report annual GHG emissions that were emitted 
           * create accounts and designate authoritzed representatie for account 
           * surrender compliance instruments (allowances and appropriate offset credits)
        * "ARB will allocate proportion of allowances to qualified facilities" 
        * Each place is "responsible for having the remaining allownces or limited number offset credits to comply with the program."" 
        * companies that miss the deadline are "subject to" being fined. 
        * How much is determined by ARB to enforce what happens next due to the violation.  

One addition Part of Cap and trade: 
* is the offset project
* GHG omitting companies can create offset projects
* Positive for businesses : 
    * Can generate ARB offset credits for compliance 
    * Needs to complete 4 Offset compliance ofset protocals 
        * to be approved 
            1. Urban forestry
            2. Forestry
            3. Livestock digesters, and desctruction of oxone depleting sustances

## Legislation Related to Environmetal Justice in California

### SB 1000
Low-income communities and communities of color often bear a disproportionate burden of pollution and associated health risks.  Environmental justice seeks to correct this inequity by reducing the pollution experienced by these communities and ensuring their input is considered in decisions that affect them. "Environmental justice" is defined in California law as the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and incomes with respect to the development, adoption, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. (Cal. Gov. Code, § 65040.12, subd. (e). 

In an effort to address the inequitable distribution of pollution and associated health effects in low-income communities and communities of color, the Legislature passed and Governor Brown signed SB 1000 in 2016, requiring local governments to identify environmental justice communities (called “disadvantaged communities”) in their jurisdictions and address environmental justice in their general plans.  This new law has several purposes, including to facilitate transparency and public engagement in local governments’ planning and decision making processes, reduce harmful pollutants and the associated health risks in environmental justice communities, and promote equitable access to health-inducing benefits, such as healthy food options, housing, public facilities, and recreation.


### Senate Bill (SB) 535 (De León, Chapter 830, Statutes of 2012) 
Directs State and local agencies to make investments that benefit California's disadvantaged communities. It also directs the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) to identify disadvantaged communities for the purposes of these investments based on geographic, socio-economic, public health, and environmental hazard criteria.

### Assembly Bill (AB) 1550 (Gomez, Chapter 369, Statutes of 2016)
Increased the percent of funds for projects located in disadvantaged communities from 10 to 25 percent and added a focus on investments in low-income communities and households.
